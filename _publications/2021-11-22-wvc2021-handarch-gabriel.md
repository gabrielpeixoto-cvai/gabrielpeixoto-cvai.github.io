excerpt: 'Despite  the  recent  advancements  in  deep  learning, sign  language  recognition  persists  as  a  challenge  in  computer vision  due  to  its  complexity  in  shape  and  movement  patterns. Current studies that address sign language recognition treat hand pose recognition as an image classification problem. Based on this approach, we introduce HandArch, a novel architecture for real-time  hand  pose  recognition  from  video  to  accelerate  the  development  of  sign  language  recognition  applications.  Furthermore, we  present  Libras91,  a  novel  dataset  of  Brazilian  sign  language (LIBRAS) hand configurations containing 91 classes and 108,896 samples. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the  accuracy  of  previous  studies  while  working  in  real-time  on video  files.  The  recognition  accuracy  of  our  system  is  99%  for the  novel  dataset  and  over  95%  for  other  hand  pose  datasets.'

Abstract
======

Despite  the  recent  advancements  in  deep  learning, sign  language  recognition  persists  as  a  challenge  in  computer vision  due  to  its  complexity  in  shape  and  movement  patterns. Current studies that address sign language recognition treat hand pose recognition as an image classification problem. Based on this approach, we introduce HandArch, a novel architecture for real-time  hand  pose  recognition  from  video  to  accelerate  the  development  of  sign  language  recognition  applications.  Furthermore, we  present  Libras91,  a  novel  dataset  of  Brazilian  sign  language (LIBRAS) hand configurations containing 91 classes and 108,896 samples. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the  accuracy  of  previous  studies  while  working  in  real-time  on video  files.  The  recognition  accuracy  of  our  system  is  99%  for the  novel  dataset  and  over  95%  for  other  hand  pose  datasets.
